## Iterated prisoner's dilemma

Alice and Bob (not their real names) are partners in a career as incompetent narcissistic petty criminals. Because Alice and Bob are incompetent, they are often caught by the police where-upon they are interviewed separately and can choose either to betray or remain silent.

Alice and Bob get caught a random number of times, N, over their career (of course you don’t know N in advance, but the punishments and average life-time should give you some idea). The task is to write a player that controls Alice’s decisions over all N choices. Objective: To design your \Alice so that she spends as little time in jail as possible.
